    "1. **Theft**: The general act of stealing property, which includes bicycles, is punishable under various sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. The specific section that may apply here is:\n",
    "   - **Section 307**: This section outlines the punishment for theft after preparation made for causing death, hurt, or restraint in order to commit theft. While this section is more severe, it reflects the seriousness of breaking a lock to facilitate the theft. The punishment under this section can include rigorous imprisonment for up to 10 years and a fine [Data: Entities (644); Sources (109)].\n",

    "2. **Theft in a Dwelling House**: If the bicycle was considered to be in a dwelling house or a similar protected area, it could also fall under:\n",

    "In summary, the suspect caught stealing a locked bicycle could face serious penalties under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, particularly under Section 307, which addresses theft involving preparation for causing restraint. The punishment could involve rigorous imprisonment for a significant term, reflecting the severity of the crime committed."

The punishment for such an offense may include imprisonment and/or fines, which are determined based on the severity of the crime and the value of the stolen property. The specific penalties are typically outlined in the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, which addresses theft and related offenses [Data: Reports (77, 61, 57, 64, 54)].\n",

This could include additional charges related to property damage or destruction, as well as potential charges for house-trespass or mischief. However, the specific section numbers for these offenses are not detailed in the available data [Data: Reports (88, 85)].\n",
